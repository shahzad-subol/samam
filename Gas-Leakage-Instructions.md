In the case of gas leakage, Samam Sensor detects the gas and sounds the alarm. At the Same time, Samam Shut off Unit shuts off the valve so that there would not be any more gas flow. When a gas leakage is detected you will be notified to your app where these devices are installed and will be shown a danger alert with the present temperature of the room. When gas leakage is suspected you should take these steps:

<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extinguish all flames, incense sticks, etc. Keep away the matches/lighters, or anything even remotely flammable.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not switch on/off any electrical switches or appliances.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately open all the doors and windows so that the gas can escape. Never open electrical fans or even an exhaust fan. Let the gas escape naturally.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isolate the main electrical supply from outside. Be sure to evacuate yourself and others from the area.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call your gas supplier or seek medical help if required.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Note: Please make sure that your oven has been turned off before opening the valve)</span></p>
